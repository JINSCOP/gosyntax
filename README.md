# TourofGo
Welcome to a tour of Go.

This project is the practise of ['A tour of Go'](https://tour.golang.org/list).


## Using the tour

Welcome to a tour of the Go programming language. The tour covers the most important features of the language, mainly:

## Basics

The starting point, learn all the basics of the language.

Declaring variables, calling functions, and all the things you need to know before moving to the next lessons.


[Packages, variables, and functions.](tourofgo/Basics/package-variables-functions/pvf-list.md)  
Learn the basic components of any Go program.

[Flow control statements: for, if, else, switch and defer]()    
Learn how to control the flow of your code with conditionals, loops, switches and defers.

[More types: structs, slices, and maps.](tourofgo/Basics/more-types-structs-slices-maps/more-types-list.md)  
Learn how to define types based on existing ones: this lesson covers structs, arrays, slices, and maps.


## Methods and interfaces

Learn how to define methods on types, how to declare interfaces, and how to put everything together.

[Methods and interfaces]()  
This lesson covers methods and interfaces, the constructs that define objects and their behavior.

## Concurrency

Go provides concurrency features as part of the core language.

This module goes over goroutines and channels, and how they are used to implement different concurrency patterns.

[Concurrency](tourofgo/concurrency/concurrency-list.md)  
Go provides concurrency constructions as part of the core language. This lesson presents them and gives some examples on how they can be used.
